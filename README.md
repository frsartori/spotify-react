# Spotify Search with React (Deprecated)

**NOTE** - This project no longer works as far as I know because of breaking changes to Spotify's public API. 

Just a little proof of concept/learning experience to search Spotify using their open search API, and to render results using React. Recently converted this project to Facebook's [boilerplate](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project setup. ES6, Webpack, Babel, etc. Check out their repo for more info.

# Run it

Scripts are unchanged from Facebook's boilerplate. I've just used their `eject` command to expose their scripts, configs, etc.

`$ npm install && npm start`

For production build (minified webpack bundle) use `$ npm run build`
