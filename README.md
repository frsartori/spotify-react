# Spotify Search with React

Just a little proof of concept/learning experience to search Spotify using their open search API, and to render results using React. Recently converted this project to Facebook's [boilerplate](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project setup. ES6, Webpack, Babel, etc. Check out their repo for more info.

# Running it

Just run `npm install && npm start` from the project root and you'll get a webpack-dev-server instance running on localhost:8080. Or if you're me you'll only be able to access it from 127.0.0.1:8080 for unexplained and mysterious reasons. Navigate to `localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/index.html` to view the app, and to get live reloading functionality. See [webpack's docs](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) for more info.
